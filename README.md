## Intruduction
The application is online store where you can buy flowers. New customers have to redister to the system. Once that is done customers can sign in, navigate through product (that is flowers), add them in a temporary shopping cart and finally place an order. 

This application will not be complete online store. It will enable and concentrates to the functionality described above, but in comparison to fully working online store it omits some functionality. Inventory is used to check if there are enough products for order, but inventory is not changed after order, so it is some what static. Application does not include any payment methods and finally there will be no handling for placed orders aside that admin can update them as finished.
